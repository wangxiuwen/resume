# Why?

I wanted to create a webpage from markdown with minimal effort, just through a script tag at the top of a page, and write pure markdown and it should work right out of the box. There are plenty of alternatives, and for most situations using something like jekyll or server side markdown will give a more consistent result, but setting this up takes some time/skill.

# Use cases
- For people who are not "tech savy" but can write markdown. No learning hurdle, add a one line at top of page.
- If you don't have server access
- Minimal effort to get decent looking text on the web
- Creating semi secure (hidden long by url) pages, such as http://oscarmorrison.com/md-page/oimasdoijasdmadeupurl-0123123#stuff-to-show-you

# Workflow
1. Create a github repo
2. add a gh-pages branch
3. drag and drop pages created using md-pages

# How?
Just create a blank file `whatever.html` and add the script tag (currently version `<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/oscarmorrison/md-page/c72eb9e9/md-page.js"></script><noscript>
`) to the top of the page, then write markdown

# What markdown?
It uses GitHub flavour markdown https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

# How does that work?
It's pretty basic, all the custom code lives here https://github.com/oscarmorrison/md-page/blob/master/script.js
but mainly it just adds some style, then uses the amazing https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown to convert text from markdown to html and replaces that in the dom (this is included in the md-page.js file)


# Does it do anything else?
Yep. I have added a couple of extra convenience features (mainly for my own use case)

## Default title
You can manually set a title using the <title> tag, if you don't it will use the first dom element (e.g a header if you start with a header)

## Open external urls externally
It modifies any link, and checks the link again the current host, if it's a different link, or not relative it will add a `target="_blank"` to the link. All other links with same hostname, or starting with `/`, `./`, `#` will not open in new window.

## Add underline to markdown
Not sure why GitHub doesn't have this, but its nice `___underline___`

## Styles
This adds some basic styles to the header. Mainly just changes the font family, and the minimal amount of styles for each of the markdown features

## Deeplink to ids
Added a bit of code to be able to deep link to in page headers e.g http://oscarmorrison.com/md-page/#tables
