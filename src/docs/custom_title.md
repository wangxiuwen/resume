## Custom Title

You can manually set a page title using the HTML (`<title> `) tag to define the page's title that is shown in a browser title bar or a page's tab.

1. Create a new html page, my-page.html

2. Add the following script tag at the very top of the page

3. Write some markdown including the `<title>` tag

```
<script src="https://rawcdn.githack.com/oscarmorrison/md-page/master/md-page.js"></script><noscript>

<title>Hello World</title>

# Hello, World.

Welcome to my simplest site. The title was set using the `<title>` tag.
